# Add Slug Import Capability to WooCommerce CSV Product Importer
Currently the WooCommerce [Product Importer](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/wiki/Product-CSV-Import-Schema#csv-columns-and-formatting) does not support importing of product Slugs (also known as permalinks). This plugin adds this functionality. 

This plugin is written as a companion to the blog post titled: [Importing Custom Permalinks / Slugs in WooCommerce](http://blog.oxrud.com/posts/import-slug-into-woocommerce)

## Instructions
Download "woo-slug-importer.zip" [here](http://blog.oxrud.com/assets/woo-slug-importer.zip), or zip up the file "woo-slug-importer.php". 

Install it using the Plugins screen in WordPress.

When creating a CSV products file, please make sure that your CSV file contains a "Slug" column.
